				<p>
					<em>OFFSHORE SS18</em> is a tax avoidance scheme and collection of beachwear. The apparel was produced in an edition of 90 total items and sold through an international corporate structure - an <a target="_blank" href="https://demystification.co/mmittee/related-matters/offshore-investigation-vehicle/">Offshore Investigation Vehicle</a> set up across a number of tax havens in June 2017 by <a href="https://dmstfctn.net">DMSTFCTN</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any customer purchasing beachwear from this store triggered a tax avoidance scheme whereby the revenue from the sale would be moved to a tax haven in order to evade corporate tax. The resulting savings were distributed to members of the public who had invested in the collection by purchasing shares in the structure, as part of a public performance held in <a target="_blank" href="https://transmediale.de/program/event/unpacking-offshore-investigation-vehicle-profit-for-all">February 2018</a>. The performance was one in a series exploring the structure and operational scope of the Offshore Investigation Vehicle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Details of the tax avoidance scheme are documented on the OFFSHORE SS18 apparel through diagrams and patterns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sales ended in June 2018, when the companies making up the Offshore Investigation Vehicle were dissolved. Their dissolution occured just before the companies' accounts were due to be submitted to tax authorities - a shielding tactic <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10807527/filing-history/QTcxWDBDT1phZGlxemtjeA/document?format=pdf&download=0">agreed upon and voted for by</a> the corporate structure's investors.

			<p><em>Profit for all</em> is a beach towel part of the OFFSHORE SS18 collection, sold through an international corporate structure set-up across a number of tax havens by dmstfctn.</p>
<p>When purchased, a tax avoidance scheme is triggered whereby the revenue from the sale is moved offshore, with resulting tax savings distributed to investors of the structure. <a href="index.html#about">Read more</a>.</p>
<h2>The movement of money</h2>
<p><em>Profit for All</em> traces the movement of money through the international corporate structure, revealing a tax avoidance scheme.</p>
<p>When an online purchase is made, Empire Management Limited - the UK private limited company at the top of the structure - transfers the revenue to its tax-exempt Seychelles subsidiary, Invest. One Limited. Once production and shipping costs are paid for, Invest. One Limited is left with untaxed profit sitting in an offshore bank account it holds in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The tax savings are then loaned back to Empire Management Limited to be distributed to its investors in the form of interim dividends - a sum UK private limited companies can pay to investors out of their profits, prior to publishing their accounts. The borrowed funds are not technically a profit but they are tactically mistaken as such by the directors of Empire Management Limited, who are then able to <a href="https://youtu.be/4ef4IypFNns">publicly reward investors</a>.</p>		</div>
